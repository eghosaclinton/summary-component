## Overview

This addresses the challenge of the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor], and it has been coded by clintt-09.

While I couldn't do the Bonus challenge(due to my lack of understanding of Javascript), I made sure to replicate the Mobile and Desktop designs with just HTML & CSS.

Two screenshots are available, showcasing the Desktop and Mobile views. Additionally, there are provided links to both the Solution on Frontend Mentor and the live site hosted on Netlify.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### What I learned

Gradients in CSS has been to tough topic for me to understand for some time now. But I used this Challenge as a starting point to conquer the issue. Gradients isn't a diificult topic to be honest, I just needed the right material.

Here is how I used CSS to apply gradients on an element in my stylesheet:

```css
.result {
  background: linear-gradient(to top, hsl(241, 81%, 54%), hsl(252, 100%, 67%));
}
```

### Continued development

With this challange done, I finally feel like I have a firm grip on responsive design. I struggled for months but now I realize the only way to truly learn and understand is through practice. I will only get better from here on out. Its truly euphoric to see my growth. LIVE!

### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) - This site really helped me out more than anything else I found online. It explained Gradients so well that I finally solved the problem that was holding me back from finishing this challenge for weeks (mostly because I kept putting it off). It's a fantastic place to learn not just CSS but everything about web development. Definitely give it a visit!
